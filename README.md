# Tellmesatory

A random story generator.

A 13kb js app with 3125 unique stories.
The code is entirely in vanilla js and no external libraries are used.

The stories involve five of the seven stages of man as described by William Shakespeare. Feel free to add more story lines to increase to increase the amount of unique experiences the project can provide. Any editing help is vastly appreciated.
